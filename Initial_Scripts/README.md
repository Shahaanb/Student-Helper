# Source Files  

This folder contains the original scripts used to develop the **Student Helper** project. Each file was individually created and tested before being combined into `helper.py`. These files can be used to understand the functionality of each feature separately.  

## Files Overview  

- `convert.py` – Handles conversions between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal.  
- `eng_dict.py` – Implements the English dictionary feature using the Oxford API.  
- `pomo.py` – Contains the logic for the Pomodoro planner.  
- `roman.py` – Converts Roman numerals to integers and vice versa.  
- `test_bases.py` – Contains the test cases for `convert.py`.  
- `test_eng_dict.py` – Contains test cases for `eng_dict.py`.  

These scripts are not required for running the main project but are included for reference and further development.
